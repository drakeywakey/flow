This is a very light flowchart making app.
Plenty of things to do!
Just started with a button that you click to add a box to the screen.
Need to:
	make that box draggable
	click inside the box to edit text inside
	add arrows (At least 2) pointing away from the box
	editable text on the arrows
Yeah. Let's start there
